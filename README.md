PLANNING
Home page:
A search field to search for stations.
A list of stations (buttons), should be possible to click on each station.

Station page (from home page):
A list with all the delays.

Map page:
A map with user marker and markers for stations with delays.


WORK
Started with interfaces to figure out which variables I was going to need, based on the data I would get from the get requests from the API.
Also, documented my planning and work, to know what I've done and needed to do.
